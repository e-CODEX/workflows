name: Create and publish Docker image
# Create and publish a Docker image to the e-CODEX JFrog, following SemVer and GitFlow conventions
# On pushes to develop, build and push a Docker image with the 'edge' label
# On tag pushes to the main branch, build and push a Docker image with the 'latest' label, as well as the SemVer tags (e.g. '1.2.3', '1.2', '1')
# On all pushes, build and push a Docker image with the short SHA checksum label
#
# Authentication to the e-CODEX JFrog is done using the JFrog CLI, which is configured with an OIDC token, obtained from the GitHub Actions OIDC provider
# Attestation of the Docker image is created and pushed to the e-CODEX JFrog as well as to the GitHub Attestations API
